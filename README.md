## Usage

In the process of creating this application were used JS functions and methods that help in working with strings, numbers, objects and arrays.

Quiz is started when the button 'Start quiz' is clicked (we use the addEventListener() method of the EventTarget interface sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target). When quiz starts the timer starts.
Every answer checks and if the answer is wrong time is subtracted from the clock.
When quiz is finished we can save our initials and score.
